  {
    "instruction": "What are Service Level Objectives (SLOs)?",
    "output": "Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are target values or ranges of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI. SLOs specify a target level for the reliability of your service. For example:\n\n- 99.9% availability (allowing 43.8 minutes of downtime per month)\n- 95% of requests complete in under 200ms\n- 99.5% of requests complete in under 500ms\n\nSLOs should be ambitious but achievable, and they drive engineering and product decisions."

  {
    "instruction": "Explain the Error Budget concept in SRE",
    "output": "An error budget is the amount of error a service can accumulate over a time period before the service is considered unreliable. It's calculated as: 100% - SLO target.\n\nFor example, if your SLO is 99.9% availability, your error budget is 0.1% (43.8 minutes per month).\n\nError budgets help teams balance reliability with feature velocity. When you're within budget, you can focus on new features. When you're approaching or exceeding the budget, you should focus on improving reliability."
